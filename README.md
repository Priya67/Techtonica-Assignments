Start your weekly assignment:
Every week you will have a mini project to work on that is due on Friday. This week you will be creating a static recipe page.
Remember: You do not need to finish this today!! Try to get a start, get the basics of your page set up. We will start working on styling tomorrow.
Remember to save early and often!
Use your creativity!!

Let’s talk about Pair Programming successfully!
Working with others is much different than working on your own, it is a skill you will be practicing during your time here
Make sure everyone understands where you are.
Make sure everyone is getting a chance to speak
Do not “steam roll” others
Ask questions when you are stuck or confused
Have a conversation about the direction you want to go with everyone before you start working

Wednesdays = Soft Skills Days!
Every Wednesday we will explore a new topic, sometimes they will be tangible like “How to give/ receive feedback” and sometimes they will be deeper conversations such as “What does it mean to be a woman/ non-binary person in tech, how will I be preceved differently”. We will only have about an hour to discuss these topics, that does not mean the conversation needs to stop there! The goal of these conversations is to open your mind and get you thinking about these topics. Everyone will have a different take and experiences to draw off of, it is important to keep the conversation civil and allow everyone a chance to speak.

This week we will be having a feedback workshop!
