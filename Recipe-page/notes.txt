Tahchin-e Morgh – Saffron Rice Cake with Chicken
Hamiupdated on November 26, 2021
Tahchin is such a versatile Persian classic! It’s a rice dish, that can be prepared with chicken, meat, veggies or plain as a side dish. Tahchin-e Morgh has a crispy golden rice crust on the outside and juicy chicken in the centre, surrounded by fragrant saffron rice and sweet and sour barberries on top. Served with the flavourful juices of the chicken or meat and some creamy yoghurt, this makes for a delicious meal, that’s also a feast for the eyes.
